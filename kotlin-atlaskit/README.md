# kotlin-atlaskit
Kotlin wrapper for [Atlaskit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/)
by Atlassian.

## Installation
`npm i @link-time/kotlin-atlaskit`

## Disclaimer
Atlaskit is a very large UI components library. This project does not
(yet) aim to be a complete wrapper by any means. It is growing
according to whatever we need at the moment.

If you want to use this library, but are missing some wrappers,
please consider opening a pull request instead of implementing them
in your own project. We will be glad to help and will make sure to
integrate your code quickly.

Help for setting up examples would also be very welcome.
